calcolo2
========
These are the TNDS laboratory exercises of PhD in Unversity of Milan.
The exercises aren't very commented so if you can't understand something just ask me :)
The binary executables are for 32bit architecture so if you see error message like:
"bash: ./prova: cannot execute binary file: Formato eseguibile non valido" it means that you 
have to recompile the program(s).
